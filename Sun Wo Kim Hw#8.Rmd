1. "The Economic Effect of Immigration Policies: Analyzing and Simulating Immigration Policy Changes" by Andri Chassamboulli and Giovanni Peri
https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074

This study examines the economic impacts of U.S. immigration policies by modeling key factors that influence migrant flows, differentiating among family-based, employment-based, and undocumented channels. Using publicly accessible data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Community Survey, Chassamboulli and Peri employ general equilibrium and econometric modeling to assess policy effects on labor markets and the broader economy. The core question addressed is: How do different immigration policies impact job creation and native labor market outcomes in the U.S.?
  
2. "Immigration, Search, and Redistribution: A Quantitative Assessment of Native Welfare" by Michele Battisti, Gabriel Felbermayr, Giovanni Peri, and Panu Poutvaara 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/90024351

This study evaluates the welfare effects of immigration on low- and high-skilled natives across 20 OECD countries using a model that accounts for skill differences, labor market search frictions, and a redistributive welfare state. The authors use publicly accessible data on immigrant labor force share, wage differentials, unemployment rates, and welfare benefits. While primarily employing a general equilibrium model, the study integrates econometric modeling through calibration techniques to simulate welfare impacts under different immigration scenarios. The main question addressed is: How do differences in immigrant skill levels and welfare policies affect native welfare in OECD countries?
